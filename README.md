# FORK
This fork is used to add a testplan for [__AAC__](https://github.com/scc-digitalhub/AAC).

# MIG

Micro-Id-Gym (MIG) is a flexible and extendable tool designed to assist system administrators and security testers in conducting
security testing on Identity Management (IdM) protocol implementations. MIG provides both a [toolsuite for penetration testing](tools/) and [testplans for IdM protocol implementations](testplans/).

A testplan for a protocol/standard, also known as a human readable testplan, comprises a set of specifications written in a format that is easily understandable by humans. It outlines the tests required to validate the compliance of a specific protocol/standard. MIG currently offers a human readable testplan that covers the OIDC protocol.

As for the tools, MIG offers a seamless testing environment known as i-mig-t, a script designed to enhance the readability of the human readable testplan by converting it into PDF format, a script to translate the majority of the human readable tests into a machine-readable format compatible with the security testing tool, MIG-T, and integration of the spid-cie-oidc-django implementation from Developers Italia.

### tools

The tool folder provides a testing environment, useful scripts and all the available tools of mig. Following is a brief description of each tool available:

* [__mig-t__](https://github.com/stfbk/mig-t): a semi-automated security testing tool provided as a [BurpSuite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) (Burp) extension based on a declarative language for security testing. It is provided as a git submodule. To access additional information, kindly consult [this link](https://github.com/stfbk/mig-t/blob/main/README.md).
* __i-mig-t__: stands for integrated mig-t and includes a Docker image containing Burp, [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), and mig-t. For more details, please refer to [this link](tools/i-mig-t/readme.md).
* __testplan-to-mr__: a script to convert the testplan from a human readable format into machine-readable format for mig-t. To access further information, please visit [this link](tools/testplan-to-mr/readme.md).
* __testplan-to-pdf__: a script for converting the human readable testplan into a PDF format to improve readability. For additional details, please visit [this link](tools/testplan-to-pdf/readme.md).

### tesplans

This folder aims to contain the specifications of testplans for IdM protocols/standards. For each IdM protocol/standard a human readable testplan is provided in CSV format. Currently, the following testplans are available in MIG:

* spid-cie-oidc: this testplan is focusing on SPID/CIE OIDC and based on [SPID/CIE OpenID Connect Regole tecniche](https://docs.italia.it/italia/spid/spid-cie-oidc-docs/it/versione-corrente/index.html)

### implementations

For each IdM protocol/standard, a human readable test plan is made available. Each IdM protocol/standard may encompass one or more implementations. The available implementations are located in this folder. Below, you'll find a brief description of the currently available implementations:

* spid-cie-oidc-django: [spid-cie-oidc-django implementation](https://github.com/italia/spid-cie-oidc-django) provided by Developers Italia.

## Quickstart

MIG currently supports the spid-cie-oidc testplan along with the implementation of [spid-cie-oidc-django](https://github.com/italia/spid-cie-oidc-django). To execute MIG with spid-cie-oidc testplan against the spid-cie-oidc-django implementation, please refer to the [folder](testplans/spid-cie-oidc/implementations/spid-cie-oidc-django/) and consult the provided [readme](testplans/spid-cie-oidc/implementations/spid-cie-oidc-django/README.md).

## Definitions

* __session__: is a list of user actions which can be seen as a UI integration test that testers use to create for web applications and which inherits the Selenium engine and its primitives. 

* __human readable test__: test cases or test specifications that are defined in a way that can be easily understood by humans, particularly testers, developers, project managers, and other stakeholders who may not have specialized technical knowledge. The human readable version of the tests prioritize clarity, simplicity, and comprehensibility, making them accessible to a broad audience without the need for deep technical expertise.

* __machine readable test__: test cases or test specifications that are formatted and structured in a way that can be interpreted, and executed by automated testing tools, scripts, or software programs. These tests are designed in JSON format and ready to be parsed and executed by [MIG-T](tools/mig-t).

## Using MIG


### To get started with MIG-T

Please refer to the following guides:

* For executing a testplan, please consult [this readme](tools/i-mig-t/readme.md#using-mig-t).
* In a generic scenario, refer to [this readme](https://github.com/stfbk/mig-t/blob/main/README.md).
