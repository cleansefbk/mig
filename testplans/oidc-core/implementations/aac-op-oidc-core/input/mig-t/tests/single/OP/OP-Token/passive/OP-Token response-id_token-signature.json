In particular, this structure is composed by three base64url encoded strings separated by dots, namely the header, payload and signature. The signature is made using the OP's private key, in such a way to be decrypted using its public key. In this test a normal flow is performed and the obtained ID Token is analyzed. In order to test if the OP correctly signed the signature part of the JWT, the third part of the string is taken and passed to a signature verifier correctly configured",
