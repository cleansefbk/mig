The received Entity Configuration must be verified through the Entity Statement released by a parent entity of the RP and this process must be repeated until the Trust Anchor. In order to verify if the OP validates this trust chain, the authority_hints in the Entity Configuration of the RP could contain wrong values. If the OP validates the request anyway, it is not compliant with the specification",
